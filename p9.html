       We are going to spend 2 weeks to make a game out of p5.js! This week is making the concept of the game. We need to make a game that has at least 3 sceens and some elements about our own life experience.

      <p>
        My life was quite boring and nothing other than what is needed to go to school has really happened to me, so I decied to make a excape game that helps me to excape from the boring life. The game will loop in the same ending if only the normal solutions to normal questions are answered. And only if you have the courage to break the rules and do different things, only then you will break out of the looping endings. 
      </p>

      <p>
      I made a floatchar that shows the main structure of the game. Also a few concept drawings.

        I don't know how well this will go but I'm pretty sure the programing of this game won't be too hard. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Looking back at this after I finished the game, I think the floatchart could have been more detailed because when I started to program this game, a lot of problems that I never thought about before has happened and the way I solved them is quite unskilled. Maybe I wasn't good enough in programing to complet this game to the degree wanted it to be. If I have time, I might try to remake this in unity.
