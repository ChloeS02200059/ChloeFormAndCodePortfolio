      The project for class 2
      </p>


      <p>
       The assignment was for each student to write a paragraph describing an item they had lost, describing the shape, size, texture, etc. of the item, and then the professor paired everyone up to draw an image of each other's lost items using p5.js programming. I was assigned to work with Judy and above is her describtion and my program.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
       The design of this lost object is by Judy, but I also designed a lost object for her, here is the design I made. I did lost a key holder that is the same design and it was the gift for a very rare album and I was never able to find it or get another one (because it was very rare). I really hope I will be able to find it one day. 
      </p>

      <h1>
        Reflections
      </h1>
      <p>
      I was able to make the ring shape of the item, but making the inner samll ring was harder than I thought, expecially while keeping the highlight.
