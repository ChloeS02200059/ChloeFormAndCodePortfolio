      <p>
      The project for class 8
      </p>

      <p>
       We are asked to an animated program that relates to our cultures and life, I made this animation as an ilustration of the air conditioner cooling the air in the room in summer, and kind of counter with the hot waves.

      <p>
        I really wanted to make some clashes of elements in this project, so I thought a way to make them smoth is to make a gradual change, and I made the image more interesting by adding the circle pattern, it also shows component of the air. I always liked the days in summer when I was liying on the floor in the room with air conditioning with nothing to do. There was only one room with air conditioning in my home, and during the summer break my grand parents lended it to me. I was really loved by them. 
      </p>

        I think the concept was pretty good but in the in class discusion it was being criticized. Maybe this was not good... although I wasn't sure how to change it. Maybe I sould have made it more complicated.
