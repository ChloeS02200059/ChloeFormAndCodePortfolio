        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
      The project for class 3 & 4
      </p>

      <p>
       Although the project wanted the program to generate faces, but it didn't say the face has to be human! I always wanted to make a duck generating program so I did this! it is a program that generates a duck in the character's bath tub everytime you click the button, and the color of the duck is set random, so you can have a pool of different ducks.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I first drew a picture in procreat, and programed it in p5.js! I found a few programs online that uses the functions that I need, at the time I didn't understand the program fully and line was confusing to me, but as I played with the numbers in the program I start to know what each line means and was able to turn this to the way I wanted it to look. 
      </p>

      <h1>
        Reflections
      </h1>
      <p>
        I really worked hard on this one but I still can't say that I can recreat this whole thing on my own, I wish to learn more some of the things used in this program like arrays so I can make something like this myself.
