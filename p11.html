      <p>
      The project for class 14(last class)
      </p>

      <p>
       We are making a webcame that has an adjustable filter. In my case I made the filters change the base color of the image. I got this inspiration from "World of Horror" which is a game that I really like. The game's graphic is pure black and white pixle art, but by allowing the player to chose a base color, the game can look a lot more eye friendly.

      <p>
        I looked at the resources in the class 13 folder and used a few chunks of codes from them, and the first three filters are simple rbg filters, but I adjusted the color for the last two filters and I really like these colors! 
      </p>

      <h1>
        Reflections
      </h1>
      <p>
        I also looked at the other resource referances but I wasn't able to learn how to use some more complicated codeings, so my program is fixed in only color changes. But I will try to learn more in the future and hopefully make a more complicated filter. (also some how this program doesn't work on the website, but it works in the p5.js link. )
