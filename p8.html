      <p>
      The project for class 9
      </p>

      <p>
       The Objective is to creat a data portrait out of a personal habi of mine. What I made is a record of the number of times that I drink liqueds during the week. the table is splited into every two hours and sevendays, and the shape represented the amount of liquid I drink, and the color represented the tyepe (water and coconut water).

      <p>
        I didn't have much time to think about what I should do for this project because I had to start recording my habit from the first day of the week. Looking back I think this might have not been a good desition, and the design is not very creative (I'm not a very creative person if I don't think about this for long enough. ). The design is a simple chart, and the recoding of the protrait is unique and easy to understand too.

      <h1>
        Reflections
      </h1>
      <p>
        I regret that I didn't make the array that I was supposed to make (but I know how to make them and I used arrays in other homeworks already), and if I had the same amount of time again, I would have made something with array. and I wished to add some animation to it but I didn't come up with a good enough idea for it.
