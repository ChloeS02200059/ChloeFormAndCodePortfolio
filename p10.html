      The project for class 11
      </p>

      <p>
       For this week we finished programing the game! The game Excape allows the player to interact with the objects in the room and find a way to excape from the room. If the player uses the key to open the door, they will enter a tunnle and lose their sight, then they will be put back into the room, into a loop and will never get out. However if the player chose to open the cabinet with their key they will get a hamer, and using the hamer to break the wall will alow the player to enter the true ending of the game, outside of the walls is a giant flower field, the player will truely be outside of the loop and will be free. Although I was only able to program to the first ending.

      <p>
        I used buttons to allow the interactions to happen. I also used lots of if else and set up functions to build the structure of the game. I drew all the visuals on procreat and uploaded them to the p5.js program. 
      </p>

      <h1>
        Reflections

      <p>
        I really have put a lot of work into this game, but still it looks really rough. I really wish that I find some time in the future and remake this game. I wish that next time I can make the interaction without using a button and make the logic of the game better.
