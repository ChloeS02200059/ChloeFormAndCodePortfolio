        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
      The project for class 7
      </p>

      <p>
       In class we each drew a image of an origin character and splited them to three pieces. Then we are put into groups of three where we exchanged parts of the character that we drew so we can all program a character that in p5.js that has very different head, chest and legs. 
      </p>

      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>
        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        My design of the character is a magician, because to me a body sliced into three parts looks really like a magic show I know. The background story of the character is below: 
      </p>

      <p>
       This is a magician that will be cut in to three-halfves because he is performing  in a magic show. he is going to fail and become three parts so our project can work. 
      </p>

      <h1>
        Reflections
      </h1>
      <p>
        I really think what I did was very complet and nice, and I was able to learn and use push() and pop(). The only thing I regret is I wished my team mates could collabortaed with me more so we can program our own character at once in the same format and exchange the parts made by each other, I think that would've been fun.
